**Short Bio:** My name is **Nguyen Minh Nhut** (*Nguyễn Minh Nhựt* - Vietnamese), and I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in **Artificial Intelligence** at [**FPT University, Ho Chi Minh Campus**](https://university.fpt.edu.vn/). I am deeply passionate about exploring the theoretical foundations and practical applications of artificial intelligence, with a strong academic and research focus on **machine learning**, **deep learning**, **speech processing**, and **computer vision**. Since the beginning of my academic journey, I have been committed to understanding how intelligent systems can be designed to better perceive, interpret, and interact with human users. As a research assistant, I actively engage in developing AI-driven solutions that enhance **human-computer interaction**, aiming to bridge the gap between computational intelligence and real-world communication systems.

I am currently working under the guidance of [**Dr. Duc Ngoc Minh Dang**](https://dnmduc.github.io/), a respected researcher in the field of artificial intelligence. Under his mentorship, I have been involved in multiple research projects that investigate **multimodal emotion recognition**, **graph-based neural networks**, and advanced learning techniques for **speech and visual understanding**. This experience has not only sharpened my technical skills in deep neural architectures and data modeling but has also nurtured a deeper appreciation for interdisciplinary AI research.

**Research Interests:** Deep Learning, Speech and Audio Processing, Human-Centered AI, Multimodal Emotion Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Graph Neural Networks.
