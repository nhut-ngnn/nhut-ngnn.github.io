Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that our papers have been accepted to the **Advances in Electrical and Electronic Engineering**.

1. **HemoGAT: Heterogeneous Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition with Cross-Modal Transformer and Graph Attention Network** â€“ A dual-stream architecture combining a Heterogeneous Multimodal Graph Attention Network (HM-GAT) and a Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) for fine-grained feature fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on IEMOCAP and competitive performance on MELD.
   *Authors:* Nhut Minh Nguyen, Trung Thanh Nguyen, Duc Ngoc Minh Dang (FPT University, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam)
   
Looking forward to sharing more details at the symposium!
