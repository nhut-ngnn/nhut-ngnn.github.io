Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that three of our papers have been accepted to the **17th International Conference on Management of Digital Ecosystems** in Kaohsiung, Taiwan:

1. **GloMER: Towards Robust Multimodal Emotion Recognition via Gated Fusion and Contrastive Learning** - A novel multimodal SER architecture that integrates a self-alignment strategy with contrastive learning and a Gated Multimodal Unit (GMU) for adaptive fusion.  
   *Authors:* Nhut Minh Nguyen, Duc Tai Phan, Duc Ngoc Minh Dang (FPT University, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam)

2. **DAAL: Dual Ambiguity in Active Learning for Object Detection with YOLOE** â€“ A new approach to enhance labeling efficiency in object detection by holistically capturing both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. DAAL computes a weighted score integrating both and selects the most informative images for annotation, leveraging YOLOE.
   *Authors:* Duc Tai Phan, Nhut Minh Nguyen, Duc Ngoc Minh Dang (FPT University, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam)

Looking forward to sharing more details at the symposium!
